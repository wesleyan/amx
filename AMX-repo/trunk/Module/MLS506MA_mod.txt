Module Name = MLS506MASwitch_mod

MLS-506 MA AV Inputs*:
Input 1-3 Composite video, for VCR(Input 1), DVD(Input 2), Aux Video(Input 3) 
Inputs 4-6 RGB Video, PC(Input 4) , MAC (Input 5), Laptop(Input 6)
Input 7 is Aux/Mix audio only.

*These inputs follow the convention set during the first installation of this device in TST114

Four Modules:

Module 1: Video & Panel Lock - vdvVSMod
-----------------------------
Input Channels:
~1-7: Switch to respective source(1-7) with both Audio and Video
11-16: Switch to respective source(1-6) with VIDEO ONLY(No video on input 7)
21-27: Switch to respective source(1-7) with AUDIO ONLY.
30-35: Set video signal type for inputs 1-3(0=YUV,1=Vid) 30-32= YUV for 1-3, 33-35 = Vid for 1-3

40:Enable "Executive Mode"-Lock Front Panel adjustments
41:Disable Executive Mode-Unlock Front Panel adjustments

50-60: RGB Delay Time(0 for 0.0 seconds, 60 for 5.0 seconds, .5 second increments)
	Also use a DEVLEV of range 0 to 10, anything outside the range has no effect. 

Feedback Channels:

--> 111-116: video source selected
--> 121-127: audio source selected

//	100: Video Type Feedback for Input 1-YUV
//	101: VIdeo Type Feedback for Input 1-Vid
//	102: Video Type Feedback for Input 2-YUV
//	103: Video Type Feedback for Input 2-Vid
//	104: Video Type Feedback for Input 3-YUV
//	105: Video Type Feedback for Input 3-Vid
//	111: Active Feedback for Input 1
//	112: Active Feedback for Input 2
//	113: Active Feedback for Input 3
//	114: Active Feedback for Input 4
//	115: Active Feedback for Input 5
//	116: Active Feedback for Input 6
//	117: Active Feedback for Input 7
//	120: Executive Mode ON Feedback
//	121: Executive Mode OFF Feedback
	Also, DEVLEV from 0-5 will accomplish the same tasks when the level is read. Any level outside of 0-5 will not cause anything to happen.

	
Module 2: Audio GAIN/Attenuation
----------------------------------
Input Channels:
1-101: Set current input's audio gain to a specific level
	Also corresponds to a DEVLEV of 0-100 where 100 is the max gain.
203: Increase audio gain level by 5
204: Decrease audio gain level by 5

Feedback Channels:
DEVLEV: AudioGain(1-7): View audio gain for channels(1-7). Each input has a specific Audio gain DEVLEV assigned to it.
102-202: Sets the channel ON for range of current audio bass step.(0-100)


Module 3: Audio TREBLE 
-----------------------
Input Channels:
1-15: Set current input's audio treble to a specific level
	Also corresponds to a DEVLEV of 0-100 where 100 is the max treble.
203: Increase audio treble of current input by +2dB
204: Decrease audio treble of current input by -2dB

Feedback Channels:
DEVLEV: AudioTreble(1-7): View audio treble for channels(1-7). Each input has a specific Audio treble DEVLEV assigned to it.
101-115: Sets the channel ON for range of current audio treble step.(0-100)



Module 4: Audio BASS
--------------------
Input Channels:
0-14: Set current input's audio bass to a specific level
	Also corresponds to a DEVLEV of 0-14 where 14 is the max bass.
203: Increase audio bass of current input by 1
204: Decrease audio bass of current input by 1
 
Feedback Channels:
DEVLEV: AudioBass(1-7): View audio treble for channels(1-7). Each input has a specific Audio bass DEVLEV assigned to it.
101-202: Sets the channel ON for range of current audio bass step.(0-100)



Module 5: Audio Volume  	vdvVolumeMod = 33001:5:0
----------------------
Input Channels:
1-101: Overall output volume
	DEVLEV AudioLevel range 0-100 controls overall volume.
102: Increment Volume by 1
103: Decrement Volume by 1

//104:Mute volume for all fixed and variable inputs.
//105:Unmute volume for all fixed and variable inputs.

-->105: Mute volume for all fixed and variable inputs.
-->106: Unmute volume for all fixed and variable inputs.

Feedback Channels:

-->125-225: overall output volume
-->230: audio mute			//201: Audio Mute Off		
					//202: Audio Mute On


DEVLEV: 0-100 AudioVolume
